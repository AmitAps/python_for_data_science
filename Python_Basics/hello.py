"""
A Syntactic error is when Python does not understand your code. For example, if you spell print "frint", you will get an error
message.


A Semantic error is when your logic is wrong.
For example, if you enter Python 102 instead of Python 101, you don't get an error message,
but your code is wrong.


We can see the actual data type in Python by using the type command.


You can change the type of the expression in Python; this is called type-casting. You can convert an int to a float.
For example, you can convert or cast the integer 2 to a float 2.


We call the numbers operands and the maths symbols, in this case addition, are called operators.


We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded.
